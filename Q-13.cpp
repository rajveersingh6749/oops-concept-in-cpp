// Q 13. Difference between Abstraction and Encapsulation

/*

| Feature     | Abstraction                     | Encapsulation                   |
| ----------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Purpose     | Hides implementation complexity | Hides data                      |
| Focus       | What an object does             | How data is accessed/modified   |
| Achieved by | Abstract classes, interfaces    | Private data + public methods   |
| Example     | `draw()` without showing code   | `getBalance()` / `setBalance()` |
