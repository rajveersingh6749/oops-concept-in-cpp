/*
Q 38. Does Python support OOP? How?

Yes, Python fully supports OOP concepts â€” classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.


Python Key Points:

    -No strict access specifiers (__var simulates private).

    -Everything is an object.

    -Uses dynamic typing (no need to declare variable types).

    -Multiple inheritance is supported safely with MRO (Method Resolution Order).
