2. Explain Compile-time (Static) and Run-time (Dynamic) Polymorphism

| Type         | When Resolved      | Achieved By                                 | Example                                               |
| ------------ | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Compile-time | During compilation | Function or operator overloading            | `add(int, int)` / `add(double, double)`               |
| Run-time     | During execution   | Function overriding using virtual functions | `virtual void sound()` in base, overridden in derived |
