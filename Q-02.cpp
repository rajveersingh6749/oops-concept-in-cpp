Q 2. What are the Four Main Principles of OOP?

    1. Encapsulation — Binding data and methods together.

    2. Abstraction — Hiding complex details and showing only essential info.

    3. Inheritance — Deriving new classes from existing ones.

    4. Polymorphism — Same function behaves differently in different contexts.
