✅ Tips for Interview Delivery

When asked to “explain with example,” start like this:

“Sure. Let’s take a simple example — suppose we are building a BankAccount class. The main goal of encapsulation here is to protect the balance. So we’ll keep it private and provide deposit and withdraw functions. Here’s how it looks…”

Then write minimal code (3–5 lines per function), explain purpose → that’s exactly what interviewers love: clarity + correctness.
