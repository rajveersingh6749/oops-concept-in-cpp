Q 34. Why is Inheritance sometimes considered bad practice?

Reasons:

    1. Tight coupling between parent and child classes

    2. Harder to change base class without affecting derived classes

    3. Can violate encapsulation

    4. Often composition provides more flexibility

➡️ Prefer composition over inheritance when the relationship is not strictly “is-a”.
